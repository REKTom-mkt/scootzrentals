			<p><b>Personal Information We Collect</b></p>

			<p>• To enhance your experience</p>

			<p>Your information helps us to enhance and personalize your shopping experience in our Stores, through our Call Centers, and on our Site. We use your personal information to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers, to improve the content of our Site for you, and to improve your Store and Call Center experience.</p>

			<p>• To improve customer service</p>

			<p>Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs. Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us when creating an account on our Site, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username. We will also communicate with you to respond to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account.</p>

			<p>• To process transactions</p>

			<p>We use your information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use your information to contact you.</p>

			<p>• To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other Site feature</p>

			<p>From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>

			<p>We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor Site traffic or personalize the Site (in the case of anonymous information collected in surveys), or to send participants an email related to the contest, promotion or survey (such as reminder or thank you notices).</p>

			<p>We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; such companies are prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>

			<p>• To send periodic communications</p>

			<p>If you place an order on our Site, the email address you provide will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. If you decide to opt-in to our promotional email list, you will receive emails that may include company news, offers, updates, related product or service information, etc.</p>

			<p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future promotional emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each promotional email. You may also contact us via phone, email, or regular mail.</p>

			<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our Site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.
